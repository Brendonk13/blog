      <description>Some background on VLANs A world without VLANs VLANs can be confusing and seem to be all-powerful, I find it helps to think about why they were needed in the first case: to feasibly scale a network.
Before VLANs, each ethernet port on a network switch could only belong to one subnet :&#39;( This meant that a corporation would need many switches in order to have a segmented network.
If this doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem valuable or doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense yet, read the next section instead of re-reading this one.</description>

      <description>Background Info VPN&amp;rsquo;s in my words The purpose of a VPN server at its heart is to give remote clients a private ip address on some private IP subnet that they cannot access.
Basically the VPN server can access some subnetworks that you can&amp;rsquo;t access but want to access.
To do this the VPN gives you an IP address on your desired subnet which effectively makes you a client on that network with access to most or all (depending on firewall/ACL rules of the default gateway for the subnet) machines on that network.</description>
